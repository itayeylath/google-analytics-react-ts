# Google Analytics with React Typescript

## Overview

Google Analytics (GA) is a powerful tool for tracking and analyzing website traffic and user behavior. Here's how it operates:

GA collects data from your website using a JavaScript tracking code that you embed in your site’s pages. This code gathers information about your visitors and sends it to Google's servers, where it is processed and made available in various reports.

## How does it work?

ga-init.ts is the primary file for integrating with Google Analytics.
We're using an object to handle GA integration for flexibility and future-proofing.

 This approach allows us to:

Support Multiple Functionalities: Easily manage page views, event tracking, and post-initialization configurations.

Future-Proofing: If we switch from ReactGA to another solution (e.g., a future GA version), we only need to update this object, not every instance in our codebase.

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________

By creating a GAInitializer and GARouteChangeTrackercomponents, We initialize GA and then render its children, ensuring that GA is set up as soon as the app is created at main.tsx, and ensuring it logs page views whenever the route changes at App.tsx.

Why This Approach?

React Way: This method aligns with React’s best practices by using a component to handle side effects.

Future-Proofing: Wrapping the App component with GAInitializer means that any changes to GA initialization only need to be made in one place.

Pros and Cons of general Implementation

Pros:
Simple Initialization: Your setup ensures that Google Analytics is initialized only once when the GAInitializer component mounts.
Page View Tracking: By providing a method to track page views, you can manually ensure that each page visit is logged.
Custom Events: The trackEventBuilder method offers flexibility to track various user interactions.

Cons:
Manual Page View Tracking: Since you're only wrapping the App component and not each route change, you must manually call trackPageView on each route change, which is prone to human error if forgotten.
Lack of Route Change Tracking: Without automatic tracking of route changes, you might miss logging some page views if trackPageView is not called explicitly in each component.
Limited User Context: Your implementation does not track detailed user interactions or demographic data beyond what GA collects by default.
