# Google Analytics with React Typescript

ga-init.ts is the primary file for integrating with Google Analytics.
We're using an object to handle Google Analytics (GA) integration for flexibility and future-proofing.

 This approach allows us to:

Support Multiple Functionalities: Easily manage page views, event tracking, and post-initialization configurations.

Future-Proofing: If we switch from ReactGA to another solution (e.g., a future GA version), we only need to update this object, not every instance in our codebase.



By creating a GAInitializer and GARouteChangeTrackercomponents, We initialize GA and then render its children, ensuring that GA is set up as soon as the app is created at main.tsx, and ensuring it logs page views whenever the route changes at App.tsx.

Why This Approach?

React Way: This method aligns with Reactâ€™s best practices by using a component to handle side effects.

Future-Proofing: Wrapping the App component with GAInitializer means that any changes to GA initialization only need to be made in one p
